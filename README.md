# ft_printf
Re-writing the standart C function printf

Task was to recode the libc’s printf function.
• There isn't the buffer management in this ft_printf function.
• Managed the following conversions: sSpdDioOuUxXcC
• Managed %%
• Managed the flags #0-+ and space
• Managed the minimum field-width
• Managed the precision
• Managed the flags hh, h, l, ll, j, et z.

To check my work you can run Makefile and after that run a qscript.sh: sh qscript.sh.
Warnings are connected to main function (Not related to this project).
